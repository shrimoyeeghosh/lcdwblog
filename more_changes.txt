TO DO TO DO TO DO TO DO TO DO DO DO DO DOOOOOOOOO

1) The header Images
2) The bug where it redirects to the top of the page instead of the blog
3) The bug where the goddamned categories tag doesnt show up
4) The feature which I'm definitely sure cause complications later where I can't add images inside the text are in admin. Or even if I do. It looks hella weird.
5) Remove subscribe to newsletter.
